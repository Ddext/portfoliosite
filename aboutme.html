                    I am a 23 year old junior coder who is currently learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript. He has some beginner knowledge on Python.

                <p class="Paras">
                    I am learning these languages via CodeNation which is a company designed to help teach people various coding languages in a three week beginner course. Eventually this course progresses into a 13 week master course.
                </p>
                <p class="Paras">
                    I aspire to be a part of the thirteen week master course due to the fact I'd like to deepen my knowledge of coding much further due to me finding it really engaging and wanting to progress my knowledge to a level where I can make indepth functional websites as well as potentially my own games among other things.

                    I'm a huge gaming fan. I've been playing games on the computer since I was 5 years old. I got a start into games such as Unreal Tournament at doom at that age which really made me interested in finding more games on the computer as I preferred the movement on computer versus controller.

                    By the time I turned 8 I had saved up enough money to buy my own laptop so I could pursue playing more games like Club Penguin. This game lead me to other sites trying to find more games where I eventually found Roblox which made me aware to what coding is. In Roblox they use a modified version of Lua and allow users to create their own games using the Roblox engine. This intrigued me and made me want to learn about coding.

                <p class="Paras">
                    My hobbies vary a lot but I love looking after animals and spending times with my friends. This past year I bought a slush machine and I started to learn how to make my own alcohol infused slushies.

                    In my spare time when I'm not at home I also like to go help my grandparents out on their farm as they live decently close by with it only being a 20 minute walk away.
